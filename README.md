Here is a fullstack application with registation and loggin created by me. Itâ€™s a notice-board.
To create it I have used: 
React, Redux, Express.js, MongoDB

See the app here (please be patient, replit takes a bit more to load a website)
https://notice-board.gabrieladun.repl.co/

I have also used following packages:
- bcryptjs - for encryting password
- express-sessions - package for facilitating handling sessions.
- connect-mongo - package to facilitate saving session in mongoDB
- multer - helps in handling the upload of photos
